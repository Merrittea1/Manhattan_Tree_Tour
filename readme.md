 ## The Manhattan Tree Tour

 ### Introduction
 This web mapping application shows all the trees within the New York Tree Census database that fall within Manhattan. There are approximately 1500 trees for users to view. This map also shows the name of each tree when clicked on and shows the health of each tree. A functional basemap gives a city feel to the map and creates visual interest for the user, as well as provides 3D building rendering, and provides road and place names. This map allows for users to explore digitally, but also to use the map to identify trees along the city streets should they so please.

 ### Major Function
 This map allows the user to pan in all directions and zoom in and out as far as they please. It also features tooltip point markers that appear when icons are selected. It also features a "want to know more?" button which has a popup with some basic information, and two clickable links for more information. Lastly, the title is stagnat and fixed, so it will always remain in the top corner, at the same size while the user interacts with the application.

 ### Libraries and Data Sources
 This map uses a basemap provided by leaflet, called 'Voyager'. It also relies on the jquery library, fontawesome, and the Chroma colors library. The data was sourced from the New York Tree Census database for both tree health, and tree name/location.
